# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Deep Learning ‚úçÔ∏èüî¢

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras for the task of handwritten digit recognition. The goal is to build a robust model capable of accurately classifying images of handwritten digits (0-9). 

## Problem Statement

The core problem is to correctly identify the numerical digit represented in an image, given a dataset of handwritten digits. This involves training a machine learning model to learn features from the images that distinguish one digit from another.

## Data

This project typically utilizes the **MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset**.

* **Source:** The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in machine learning and deep learning. It's often available directly through deep learning libraries like TensorFlow/Keras.
* **Description:** It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. Each image is a grayscale 28x28 pixel square.
* **Preprocessing (Typical):** Images are often normalized (pixel values scaled from 0-255 to 0-1) and reshaped to fit the input requirements of a CNN.

## Methodology: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

The project implements a Convolutional Neural Network, a class of deep neural networks most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.

### Key Components of the CNN Architecture (as typically seen in MNIST examples):

* **Convolutional Layers (`Conv2D`):** Learn spatial hierarchies of features from the input images (e.g., edges, textures, parts of digits).
* **Pooling Layers (`MaxPooling2D`):** Downsample the feature maps, reducing dimensionality and making the model more robust to variations in digit position.
* **Flatten Layer:** Converts the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector to be fed into dense layers.
* **Dense (Fully Connected) Layers:** Perform classification based on the features extracted by the convolutional layers.
* **Activation Functions:** ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is commonly used in hidden layers, and Softmax is used in the output layer for multi-class classification.
* **Optimizer:** Adam optimizer is typically used for efficient training.
* **Loss Function:** Sparse Categorical Crossentropy is often used for integer-encoded labels in multi-class classification.

### Training Process:

* The model is compiled with an optimizer and loss function.
* It's then trained on the training dataset for a specified number of epochs, with validation on a separate validation set.
* Performance is evaluated on the unseen test set.
